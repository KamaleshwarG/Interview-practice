Devin has land which is a perfect square shape He wants to try a different pattern of cultivation. He divided his complete land into NvN equal-sized cells where N in the number of partitions he planned in each side of the land Except the middle row and middle column, he cultivated grass to graze his cows and shamps He has cultivated different commercial crops in the middle row cells and middle column cells so that floods will not spoil the commercial crops much

He anticipated different incomes from each cell. He maintained those income details in a table with NxN cells. He named the table an income table His formula for total profit T from complete land = (product of income tables middle row values)+( product of income tables middle column values)

When he calculated his expenditure interestingly, he found it is exactly equal to the reverse of the total profit T

He wanted to continue the same pattern of cultivation multiple times. He needs your help in designing a program that accepts income details of each cell of the income table and print the investment he made for that tenure.

Read the input from STDIN and print the output to STDOUT. Do not write arbitrary strings while reading the input or while printing, as these contribute to the standard output

### Constraint:

1<N<=25

N is always an odd number

Input Format:

The first line of input contains an integer, N, where N is the number of partitions he planned in each side of the land. Next N lines have N integers, each separated by single white space.

### Output Format:

The output contains the total profit T

Sample Input,

3

123

47

6511

784

### Sample Output1;

14

### Explanation1:

From the sample input, given land size N is 3 ie 3x3 equal-sized cells.

Given the number of partitions is. 123

6511

784

Income table middle row values are 6, 5, and 11, their product = 6*5*11=330. Income table middle column values are 2,5 and 8, their product=2*5*8 = 80. His formula for total profit T from complete land = (product of income tables middle row values)+(product of income tables middle column values) = 330+80=410 Total Investment T = Reverse of 410 is 014, ignoring leading zeroes we get the output as 14.

### Sample Input 2:

5
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
2 3 2 1 1
5 4 3 2 1
4 4 1 2 3

### Sample Output 2:

651

## Explanation 2:

From the sample input, given land size N is 5 i.e 5x5 equal-sized cells.

Given the number of partitions is

1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
2 3 2 1 1
5 4 3 2 1
4 4 1 2 3

Income table middle row values are 2,3,2,1 and 1, their product = 2*3*2*1*1= 12.

Income table middle column values are 3,8,2,3 and 1, their product = 3*8*2*3*1=144.

 His formula for total profit T from complete land = (product of income tables middle row values)+(product of income tables middle column values) = 12 +144=156 Total investment = Reverse of 156 = 165

# Basic code structure:

def evaluateMatrix(n,a):
         sum = 0

#a is given square matrix of size n.
        return sum

def main():

    n = int(input())

    a = []

    for i in range(n):

    arr list (map(int, input().split()))

    a.append(arr)

    print(evaluateMatrix(n,a))
main()
