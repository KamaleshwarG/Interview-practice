# Single File Programming Question

Kristen is a contender for valedictorian of her high school. She wants to know how many students (if any) have scored higher than her in the five exams given during this semester.

Create a class named "Student" with the following specifications:

• An instance variable named score

holds five students' exam scores.

. The first score will be Kristen's score.

. A void input() function

reads 5 integers and saves them

to scores.

• An int calculate TotalScore() function that returns the sum of the student's scores.

### Input format:

The first line of input consists of the number of

students.

The second line of input consists of five scores

from the students.

### Output format:

The output displays the number of students who scored higher than Kristen.

### Code constraints:

1<= n <= 100

1<= examscore <= 50

### Sample test cases:

##### Input 1:

4
90  70 80 70 90
90 80 90 90 100
60 70 80 90 40
80 60 70 80 50

##### Output 1:

1

##### Input 2:

5
50 60 70 80 90
90 90 90 90 90
90 80 89 90 79
56 78 90 70 80
80 70 80 89 79


##### Output2:
4

### Note:

The program will be evaluated only after the

"Submit Code" is clicked.

Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.

Use python
